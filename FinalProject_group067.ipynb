    "- It has been a commonly held stimga that height plays a pivotal role in the world of basketball. This project seeks to ultimately challenge this opinion, finding whether or not there actually exists a correlation between an NBA player's height (specifically point guards) and their success/performance in the league. Utilizing common statistics that usually predict a player's success in a game such as points per game, assists, turnovers, defensive rating, etc. as well as taking into account their height, we can build a more accurate baseline of success among these players. By analyzing these datasets this project will provide a more statsitcal and defintive answer in determining correlation between height in point guards and their performance in the NBA."

    "- We chose to do research on this project to contest the common stigma that height plays a pivotal role in basketball players. In the modern age of the NBA we are seeing more and more players use different unique skill sets that utilize other parts of their game rather than height. The major factor in allowing these smaller players to ultimately perform better than their taller counterparts revolves around the game's more fast paced playstyle and play around the 3 pointer. With the court more spaced out, point guards are given more freedom on offense, players like Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard have taken advantage of the new era style of play and have put up incredible statistics throughout the recent seasons. \n",

    "    This article provides data to players prior to 2013 where the game was played much differently than it is now, where height isn't factored to be as important then it used to be. Throughout this article the point guard Trey Burke is used as a sample group and compared with other point guards in the league. Standing 6'1 in height Burke represents the middle of the bell curve in terms of heights amongst NBA point guards. Rather than utilizing traditional stats this article uses PER also known as player efficiency rating which \"is the overall rating of a player's per-minute statistical production\" (ESPN). In conclusion this article ultimately states 6'3 as being the optimal height for point guards, however as the league has progressed, this number has shifted due to the way point guards are now playing the game more spread out with more 3PTs. \n",

This article focuses on the key skillsets that make star point guards so dominant. These players range Steph Curry and his 3pt shooting to Steve Nash and his passing ability. With so many successful point guards each playing the game differently as well as with differing heights this article allows us to build a better baseline in determining how successful a player can be for their team.

    "We think that being taller provides advantages that can heavily impact the game. Even though players like Stephen Curry, a phenomenal player despite his size, exist in the league as incredible point guards that don't need to utilize their height to be successful for their team. basketball’s meta changed after Curry’s domination in 2015-2016. We can see more and more point guards looking to make more 3-pointers rather than driving in or looking for assists. As more guards begin to utilize Curry’s style in late seasons we can better see the impact height has on this style.\n",
