    "- It has been a commonly held stimga that height plays a pivotal role in the world of basketball. This project seeks to ultimately challenge this opinion, finding whether or not there actually exists a correlation between an NBA player's height (specifically point guards) and their success/performance in the league. Utilizing common statistics that usually predict a player's success in a game such as points per game, assists, turnovers, defensive rating, etc. as well as taking into account their height, we can build a more accurate baseline of success among these players. By analyzing these datasets this project will provide a more statsitcal and defintive answer in determining correlation between height in point guards and their performance in the NBA."

    "- We chose to do research on this project to contest the common stigma that height plays a pivotal role in basketball players. In the modern age of the NBA we are seeing more and more players use different unique skill sets that utilize other parts of their game rather than height. The major factor in allowing these smaller players to ultimately perform better than their taller counterparts revolves around the game's more fast paced playstyle and play around the 3 pointer. With the court more spaced out, point guards are given more freedom on offense, players like Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard have taken advantage of the new era style of play and have put up incredible statistics throughout the recent seasons. \n",
